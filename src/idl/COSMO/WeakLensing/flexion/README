\f0\fs24 \cf0 List of codes included in the suite, with a brief description:\
\
1) Identify_objects.pro: takes input (lensed) image from raytracing code and identifies the locations of all brightness peaks. It outputs a list of positions xs, ys which specifies the catalogue of objects detected. This code calls find and search2d, both of which should be included in your IDL library. If not, you should be able to find them fairly easily in google, or I can send them to you. \
\
2) measure_flexion_sim.pro: Takes the lensed galaxy image and the list of sources given by identify_objects.pro, checks for blending of images, iteratively resizes postage stamps until convergence is reached, and measures the shear and flexion of the images. You have the option to calculate the unweighted moments or use weighted moments. In my experience, even in the absence of noise in your images, you're better off using the weighted moments, but I've included both codes in the package. Flexion measurements are then output to a file. Output flexion values are in units of /radian\
\
3) quickmoments.pro: short script to quickly calculate the ellipticity, semi-major axis and centroid of the image using unweighted moments. Called by measure_flexion_sim.pro\
\
4) flexion_moments.pro/flexion_moments_uw.pro: scripts compute the HOLICs in the weighted and unweighted cases. I've included both for completeness, but you're better off using the weighted case regardless of the absence of noise in the raytraced images. \
\
5) weightfunc.pro: takes the input postage stamp and computes the gaussian weight function to be used in the weighted moments calculation\
\
6) halflight.pro: called by measure_flexion_sim.pro; calculates the halflight radius of a galaxy image. \
\
Note that the postage stamp and object identification routines only work if you don't have noise in your images. If you end up using noisy images, you'll need to use a program like SExtractor to extract the background images. I have scripts to do this, so let me know if you end up doing this.}
