Welcome to CAMB_icosmo_v1.1 the CAMB module of iCosmo
-----------------------------------
Oct 08 - CAMB_icosmo_v1.1
Oct 08 - CAMB_icosmo_v1.0 Written by Anais Rassat.

PURPOSE: 
The CAMB module of iCosmo currently links a Fortran code written by Jochen Weller, which calculates the Planck Fisher matrix code based on Antony Lewis' code CAMB.  

In a future release, the matter power spectrum, transfer function and the CMB power spectrum will be calculated using CAMB (as optional).  

At the moment the CAMB module is only used for the Planck Fisher matrix calculation.

NEW: You can now be in any directory when calling CAMB from iCosmo.

HELP:
----
Online CAMB and iCosmo forums are found here: www.cosmocoffee.info

Installing CAMB: 
---------------

Do not install the latest version of CAMB. Instead download the planck_icosmo.tar.gz from www.icosmo.pbwiki.com.

1) In your iCosmo directory, unzip and untar planck_icosmo.tar.gz.
This will create a new module folder, called camb, which must be placed as: 
./icosmo_v1.1/camb/

2)Untar CAMB_for_iCosmo.tar ensuring that it is found in the following directory: 
~/Work/.
This will create two new folders:
~/Work/CAMB_for_iCosmo/CAMB
~/Work/CAMB_for_iCosmo/DATA

Set yourself in the folder: 
./Work/CAMB_for_iCosmo/CAMB
Modify the Makefile to account for your computers specifications and fortran compiler set links to your LAPACK and BLAS libraries.
To compile CAMB and the Planck Fisher forecast file, type 'make'. 

Calculating a Planck Fisher matrix using CAMB and iCosmo:
----------------------------------------------
NEW: You can now be in any directory when calling CAMB from iCosmo.

You can now calculate the Planck Fisher matrix simply using the following commands: 

> fid = set_fiducial()
> cosmo = mk_cosmo(fid)
> planck = mk_fisher_planck(fid, cosmo, verbose=verbose, cambpath=cambpath, params=params, file=file)

Nb: 
"cambpath" is the *full* pathname to where the CAMB folder is
"params" is the name of params.ini file (cambtemp.ini is default)
"file" is the *full* pathname the output planck fisher matrix file (../Data/fsiher_planck_EUCLID.dat is default).

Note:
---------
The Planck calculation takes about 40 min a macbook, 10.5.2, 2 GB Memory 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM, 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.
