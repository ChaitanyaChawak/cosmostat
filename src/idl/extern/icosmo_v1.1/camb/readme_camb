=====================
INSTALLATION
=====================
You need to install the latest version of CAMB

Specify its filepath in fid.calc.cambpath


=====================
EXAMPLE
=====================

f = set_fiducial(calc_in:{cambpath:'~/Work/CAMB_081015/CAMB/})
test = mk_camb(f)


=====================
NOTE FOR ALEX
=====================

At the moment all the code does is run CAMB, it doesn't read anything in
So there is currently no output to the routine mk_camb
